### Spin-offs

Currently, this repository only contains the backend logic for a card game of hilo. However, as this project expands, I forsee it branching out to other casino games such as:

- Blackjack
- Poker
- Bridge
- [大弟](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_twohttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_two) [da di]

Furthermore, as this project grows in scale an size, I dream that it would be able to implement:

- Multiplayer modes
- Fully functional players written in Python code
